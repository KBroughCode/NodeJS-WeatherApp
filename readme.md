# MyWeatherApp ReadMe

A simple nodeJS application. The point in this was to practice nodeJS so the frontend is very basic and has a lot of room for improvements.

## Getting started

### npm i

first of all run **npm i** to get install dependencies.

### npm run dev

**npm run dev** will use nodemon so hot reload can take place one any changes have been made/saved to files - note this will also include changes made to hbs files.

### npm run start

can be used as an alternative to **npm run dev** however will not have hot reload. This is primarily for Heroku to use in production.
